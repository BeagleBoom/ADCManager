#Kudos
- A big and warmly "Thank you!" goes to Gregory Raven (@Greg-R) for his [adaptation and documentation of running an MCP3008 with the PRU](https://github.com/Greg-R/pruadc1). This project was heavily inspired of his porting efforts of [Derek Molloys assembler example](http://exploringbeaglebone.com/chapter13/).
- No less than Gregory Raven we want to thank Derek Molloy for his great book "Exploring BeagleBone" which helped us to understand the basics of programming the pru and putting together the IO-overlays.
